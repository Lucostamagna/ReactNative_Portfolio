<p>   Hello! 👋🏾 Thank you for visiting my GitHub repository! Here, you will find my latest React Native projects. I am committed to continuously improving my development skills, with a strong focus on design. As a Mobile Developer, I am currently seeking remote or relocation opportunities. If you believe I could be a valuable addition to your team, please don't hesitate to get in touch! I would be delighted to connect with you.</p>

 <h2 align="left"> Login - Logout </h2>

 <p> 
In this project, I developed a login system designed to ensure secure authentication of users and maintain their active sessions, even after logging out. This system provides each user with a unique token that is automatically generated and securely stored in AsyncStorage. If you are not a user, you can register and log in to use the application. Users are stored in a MongoDB-backed database, and the application runs online.

The application design is fully responsive, meaning it adapts to any mobile device size. Additionally, I incorporated LottieFiles animations to enhance the visual experience of the application.

I continue to work on optimizing the project, constantly seeking ways to improve its performance and functionality.  💥

<h2 align="left"> Movie App </h2>
<p>
  🎬
  I had a great time creating this application, and I also gained extensive knowledge about movies! Here, you can explore the latest cinema releases in real-time, as the information is sourced from an up-to-date API. Additionally, you can stay informed about the top-rated, most acclaimed, and popular movies. I have also included a detailed movie session where you can find all the relevant information you need. Feel free to check it out!

<h2 align="left">Finance App</h2>
 
 🔔
<p>
This project was very significant to me as it was part of my experience during an internship organized by the leading developers at Mercury LLC. The application focuses on the finance domain and was developed using the Ignite development template.
The application features a series of cards that compose a carousel and display detailed information as required. Each time a scroll is made, an expense related to that card is shown with a custom style.
One of the main challenges of this project was implementing a smooth and fluid carousel with seamless transitions. Additionally, custom components were developed to display the expenses associated with each card, utilizing unique styles that seamlessly integrate with the overall design of the application.
Furthermore, a functionality was implemented to visualize all expenses made across all cards, providing users with an overview of their finances.

This project allowed me to acquire fundamental skills in mobile application development and enhance my knowledge of React Native. Additionally, I learned to work as part of a team, collaborating with other developers and following industry best practices.

<p> On this occasion, I developed a simple screen using React Native and integrated several functionalities to enhance practices. 💻
I focused on incorporating the following features:
🎠 Image Carousel with pagination.
📜 Flatlist.
⚡️ Alert Component.
🎨 Icons and Typography Changes: To add a visual and stylish touch to my screen.
⚡️ LottieFiles Animations.
🌗 Dark and Light Mode: I implemented a system to switch between dark and light modes using React Native hooks such as useContext and useReducer. This allows users to personalize their experience based on their viewing preferences.
🗺 Map Integration: I also worked on integrating a map that displays the general location. Although I am still working on its functionalities, I am excited about its potential to enhance the interactivity of the screen.

</p>
<p> ⚡️ In my latest project, I focused on honing my skills in interactions with the BackEnd. Building upon the success of my previous login project, where I achieved user creation and active session management, I've taken a leap forward by developing a comprehensive system. This system enables not only the viewing of all existing product categories but also the direct creation of new categories within the application, along with the ability to modify the ones already present.

Highlighted Features:

-Category Exploration.
-Creation of New Categories.
-Modification of Existing Categories.
-Image Upload.
-Image Viewing.

<p> ⚡️ 
Strengthening my skills in navigation with Stack, Tab, and Drawer in React Native. I implemented a robust authentication flow, utilizing AsyncStorage to securely store tokens. Additionally, I integrated Redux Toolkit for efficient state management.

Highlighted Features:

Advanced navigation using Stack, Tab, and Drawer Navigator.
Robust and secure authentication flow.
Efficient use of AsyncStorage for token persistence.
Implementation of Redux Toolkit for efficient state management.
