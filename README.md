 <h2 align="left"> Login - Logout </h2>

 <p> 
In this project, I developed a login system designed to ensure secure authentication of users and maintain their active sessions, even after logging out. This system provides each user with a unique token that is automatically generated and securely stored in AsyncStorage. If you are not a user, you can register and log in to use the application. Users are stored in a MongoDB-backed database, and the application runs online.

The application design is fully responsive, meaning it adapts to any mobile device size. Additionally, I incorporated LottieFiles animations to enhance the visual experience of the application.

I continue to work on optimizing the project, constantly seeking ways to improve its performance and functionality.  💥

<h2 align="left">Finance App</h2>
 
 🔔
<p>
This project was very significant to me as it was part of my experience during an internship organized by the leading developers at Mercury LLC. The application focuses on the finance domain and was developed using the Ignite development template.
The application features a series of cards that compose a carousel and display detailed information as required. Each time a scroll is made, an expense related to that card is shown with a custom style.
One of the main challenges of this project was implementing a smooth and fluid carousel with seamless transitions. Additionally, custom components were developed to display the expenses associated with each card, utilizing unique styles that seamlessly integrate with the overall design of the application.
Furthermore, a functionality was implemented to visualize all expenses made across all cards, providing users with an overview of their finances.

This project allowed me to acquire fundamental skills in mobile application development and enhance my knowledge of React Native. Additionally, I learned to work as part of a team, collaborating with other developers and following industry best practices.

<p> On this occasion, I developed a simple screen using React Native and integrated several functionalities to enhance practices. 💻
I focused on incorporating the following features:
🎠 Image Carousel with pagination.
📜 Flatlist.
⚡️ Alert Component.
🎨 Icons and Typography Changes: To add a visual and stylish touch to my screen.
⚡️ LottieFiles Animations.
🌗 Dark and Light Mode: I implemented a system to switch between dark and light modes using React Native hooks such as useContext and useReducer. This allows users to personalize their experience based on their viewing preferences.
🗺 Map Integration: I also worked on integrating a map that displays the general location. Although I am still working on its functionalities, I am excited about its potential to enhance the interactivity of the screen.
