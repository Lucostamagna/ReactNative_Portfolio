In this project, I developed a login system designed to ensure secure authentication of users and maintain their active sessions, even after logging out. This system provides each user with a unique token that is automatically generated and securely stored in AsyncStorage. If you are not a user, you can register and log in to use the application. Users are stored in a MongoDB-backed database, and the application runs online.

The application design is fully responsive, meaning it adapts to any mobile device size. Additionally, I incorporated LottieFiles animations to enhance the visual experience of the application.

I continue to work on optimizing the project, constantly seeking ways to improve its performance and functionality.
