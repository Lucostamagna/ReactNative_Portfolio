<p>   Hello! 👋🏾 Thank you for visiting my GitHub repository! Here, you will find my latest React Native projects. I am committed to continuously improving my development skills, with a strong focus on design. As a Mobile Developer, I am currently seeking remote or relocation opportunities. If you believe I could be a valuable addition to your team, please don't hesitate to get in touch! I would be delighted to connect with you.</p>
  
 <h2 align="left"> Login - Logout </h2>
 <br/>
 <p> 
In this project, I developed a login system designed to ensure secure authentication of users and maintain their active sessions, even after logging out. This system provides each user with a unique token that is automatically generated and securely stored in AsyncStorage. If you are not a user, you can register and log in to use the application. Users are stored in a MongoDB-backed database, and the application runs online.

The application design is fully responsive, meaning it adapts to any mobile device size. Additionally, I incorporated LottieFiles animations to enhance the visual experience of the application.

I continue to work on optimizing the project, constantly seeking ways to improve its performance and functionality.  💥

  🎬
  I had a great time creating this application, and I also gained extensive knowledge about movies! Here, you can explore the latest cinema releases in real-time, as the information is sourced from an up-to-date API. Additionally, you can stay informed about the top-rated, most acclaimed, and popular movies. I have also included a detailed movie session where you can find all the relevant information you need. Feel free to check it out!
